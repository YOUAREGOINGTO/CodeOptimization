* Text file has Tle lines  and btain the co-ordinates for one day with time frame of one minute.(get_satellite_positions)
* Convert the co-ordinates to longitude, latitude and laltitude.(ecef2lla,convert_to_lla_single)
* Compare within a given range of latitude and longitude.(filter_positions)
* Code Optimization with Distributed Computing.(Using Dask Library)
# Distributed Computing
* Using Dask Bag as Data is Unstructured and Dak Bag has map , filter functions.
* Code can be Easily scaled By Replacing Local Cluster with Required Cloud Cluster.(Production Ready Code)
